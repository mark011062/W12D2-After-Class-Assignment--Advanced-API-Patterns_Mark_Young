Race Weekend Checklist Manager API

Advanced API Patterns – Production-Ready REST API

Overview

This project is a production-ready REST API built for the Advanced API Patterns assignment. The API models a race weekend checklist manager for motorcycle racing teams, allowing authenticated users to manage race events and tasks while enforcing security, rate limiting, and best-practice API design patterns.

The system demonstrates real-world backend architecture, including JWT authentication, role-based access control, dependency injection, rate limiting, and automated testing with coverage enforcement.

Features
Authentication & Authorization

User registration and login

Secure password hashing (bcrypt)

JWT-based authentication

Role-based access control:

Users manage their assigned tasks

Admins create events and assign tasks

Race Events

Admin-only creation of race weekend events

Events include track, location, and event date

Tasks

Tasks belong to race events

Tasks can be assigned to specific users

Users can:

View assigned tasks

Update completion status

Delete their own tasks

Rate Limiting

Redis-backed rate limiting on task endpoints

Standard rate-limit response headers:

X-RateLimit-Limit

X-RateLimit-Remaining

X-RateLimit-Reset

Redis is fully mocked in tests

Testing

Pytest test suite

SQLite test database

Dependency overrides for database and Redis

Coverage enforcement (--cov-fail-under=80)

Tech Stack

Python 3.12

FastAPI

SQLAlchemy

SQLite (tests)

JWT (PyJWT)

Passlib + bcrypt

Redis (rate limiting)

pytest + pytest-cov
